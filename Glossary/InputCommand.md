# Input Command
## Definition
Input Commands can be used to trigger processes and actions on a specific [Device's](./Device.md) [Workflow](./Workflow.md).  This can be setting a value, sending [Messages](./Message.md), generating [Output Commands](./OutputCommand.md) or sending events to a [State Machine](./StateMachine.md).  Input Commands are exposed as a [REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer).

## Example
The roller on the *Plymouth IoT Conveyor Belt* became jammed.  The company engineer wanted to reset the conveyor belt to see if they could get it running again.  They used a custom application written by one of their software engineers that called the Input Command with its [REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer).
