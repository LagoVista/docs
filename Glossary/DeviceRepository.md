A Device Repository can only belong to one [Deployment Instance](.DeploymentInstance.md) and a Deployment Instance can only have one Device Repository. Some of the information that is stored includes 

- [Attributes](./Attribute.md) 
- [Device Configuration](./DeviceConfiguration.md) 
- [Device ID](./DeviceID.md) 
- [Device Model](./DeviceModel.md)
- [Device Specific Settings](./CustomizedSetting.md)
