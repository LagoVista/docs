# Service Ticket 
## Definition
Service Tickets are produced within [Field Service Lite](./FieldServiceLite.md).  They are produced by an [Error Code](./ErrorCode.md) in a [Device Configuration](./DeviceConfiguration.md).  Service Tickets contain information on what went wrong with the [Device](./Device.md) as well as other information useful in correcting the [Error Code](./ErrorCode.md).

## Example
The manager of Tampa's *Plymouth Manufacturing* received a Service Ticket on her [Service Board](./ServiceBoard.md) stating that Belt #4 did not start that morning.  The Service Ticket contained several tabs which showed what went wrong, suggestions on how to correct the problem, parts and resources that may be needed in the repair as well as the current status of the error.
