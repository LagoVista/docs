# Input
## Definition
When a [Message](./Message.md) is received from a [Device](./Device.md), the Input Translator is responsible for extracting data from the [Payload](./Payload.md) and making it available within the [Workflow](./Workflow.md).  



<br>
<br>
<br>

## Example
The *Plymouth IoT Conveyor Belt* sent a [Message](./Message.md) to its [Deployment Instance](./DeploymentInstance.md) with a [Payload](./Payload) of 425Â°.  The Input Translator extracted 425 as an integer and made it available in the `temperature` [Workflow](./Workflow.md) as well as sending it to the [Data Stream Writer](./DataStreamWriter.md) to be saved as an [Attribute.md](./Attribute.md).
