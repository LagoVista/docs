# Service Board
## Definition
A Service Board is a module within [Field Service Lite](./FieldServiceLite.md).  An owner is assigned to each of these Boards. When an [Error Code](./ErrorCode.md) is generated on a [Device](./Device.md), a [Service Ticket](./ServiceTicket.md) is produced by the [Device Repository](./DeviceRepository.md) and organized on appropriate Service Boards.

## Example
When the manager of Tampa's *Plymouth Manufacturing* location arrived at work, she checked her Service Board on the NuvIoT [Dashboard](./Dashboard.md).  There was one [Service Ticket](./ServiceTicket.md) which stated that belt #4 did not start that morning.
