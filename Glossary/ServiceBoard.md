# Service Board
## Definition
A Service Board is a module within [Field Service Lite](./FieldServiceLite.md).  When an [Error Code](./ErrorCode.md) is generated on a [Device](./Device.md), a [Service Ticket](./ServiceTicket.md) is added to the appropriate Service Boards depending on which [Device](./Device.md) sent the message.

## Example
When the manager of Tampa's *Plymouth Manufacturing* location arrived at work, she checked her Service Board on the NuvIoT.  There was one [Service Ticket](./ServiceTicket.md) which stated that belt #4 did not start that morning.
