# Versioning 
## Definition
When creating or reconfiguring a [Solution](./Solution.md), it may be saved at any point as a Version of that [Solution](./Solution.md).  Versions may then be used in two different ways:
- Updates and changes may be made on a new Version while the working [Deployment Instance](./DeploymentInstance.md) will continue to operate uninterrupted. The new Version may be deployed once bugs are removed and changes are fully tested.   
- If a glitch or bug is identified after a Version has been released, it is possible to rollback to a previous Version of the [Solution](./Solution.md) that doesnâ€™t have the problem.

## Example
Shortly after updating the [Solution](./Solution.md) for their conveyor belts, *Plymouth Manufacturing* discovered a problem in capturing data.  They contacted NuvIoT and had them revert back to the last Version of the [Solution](./Solution.md) which did not have the glitch.
