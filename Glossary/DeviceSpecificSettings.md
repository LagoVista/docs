Note: Quick Def. 9/15 Example.  Should this be called Properties? Instead of Device Specific Settings? How?  By using Device Configuration or Firmware?

# Device Specific Settings (Properties)
## Definition
Properties are defined in a [Device Configuration](./DeviceConfiguration.md) and allow values to be saved with a specific [Device](./Device.md).  These settings allow for customizing each [Device](./Device.md) individually and can be used in [Workflows](./Workflow.md) and [Firmware](./Firmware.md).

## Example
*Plymouth Manufacturing* decided to upgrade their security system based on the camera's location. In high-traffic areas, they only wanted to record fifteen seconds of video when motion was detected.  They wanted to record two minutes in high-risk areas. They were able to create and configure a Device Property on each [Device](./Device.md) to define how much time was recorded.
