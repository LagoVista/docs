## Example
The temperature Sensor on the *Plymouth IoT Conveyor Belt" measured the amount of heat produced by the bearings.  This temperature was then sent from the Sensor to the [Control Board](./ControlBoard.md) and then on to the [Device Configuration](./DeviceConfiguration.md) in the [Cloud](./Cloud.md) for analysis.
