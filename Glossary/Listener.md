# Listener
## Definition
A Listener is a [Pipeline Module](./PipelineModule.md) whose primary function is to “listen” for and identify [Messages](./Message.md) being sent from a [Device](./Device.md) to the [Deployment Instance](./DeploymentInstance.md).  Once the [Message](./Message.md) is received, the Listener will pass the [Message](./Message.md) on to a [Planner](./Planner.md) which will compile information into a [PEM](./PEM.md) and send it to the appropriate [Route](./Route.md).

## Example
The *Plymouth IoT Conveyor Belt* is programmed to send it's bearings' temperature to the [Deployment Instance](./DeploymentInstance.md) every five minutes.  Once it is sent, the Listener detects that there is a [Message](./Message.md) that needs to be processed.  The Listener receives the [Message](./Message.md) and passes it on to a [Planner](./Planner.md).
