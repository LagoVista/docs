# IoT Edge
## Definition
 
[Deployment Instances](./DeploymentInstance.md) are typically deployed in the [Cloud](./Cloud.md), which means they operate and store information on remote servers.  An IoT Edge deployment allows the [Deployment Instance](./DeploymentInstance.md) to be deployed locally.

## Example
*Plymouth Manufacturing* wanted to use [Machine Learning](./MachineLearning.md) to analyze vibration data from their conveyor belts. To do so, they needed to gather lots of samples at a very fast rate. Sending this amount of data over the internet was not practical so they chose to operate the [Deployment Instance](./DeploymentInstance.md) on site using IoT Edge.
