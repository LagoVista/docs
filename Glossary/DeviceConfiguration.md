# Device Configuration
## Definition
A Device Configuration is a set of [Pipeline Modules](./PipelineModules.md) that contain instructions on how [Messages](./Message.md) from a [Device](./Device.md) are to be handled and stored in the [Cloud](./Cloud.md). A Device Configuration is available for reuse in more than one [Device Model](./DeviceModel.md).

## Example
*Plymouth Manufacturing* wants to buy a new and more efficient IoT Conveyor Belt that is made with a stronger belt material. *NuvIoT* was able to use the same set of instructions, or Device Configuration, from the original *Plymouth IoT Conveyor Belt* without making any changes to the system.
