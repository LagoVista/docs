# Data Stream

## Definition

Data Streams are a powerful way to capture and organize data.  They produce information consisting of the [Device ID](./Glossary/DeviceID.md), [Message ID](./MessageID.md) and a time stamp for when the data was received.  The Data Streams may then be used within a [Deployment Instance](./Glossary/DeploymentInstance.md) for calculations and comparisons.  They may also be stored for later reference and use.

## Example

Temperatures of the *Plymouth IoT Conveyor Belt* were saved as Data Streams.  Every time a bearings' temperature was sent from the [Device](./Glossary/Device.md) to the [Cloud](./Glossary/Cloud.md), it was saved in a special format that allowed the engineer to look at what temperatures were produced over a period of time.
