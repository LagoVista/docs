# Message
## Definition
IoT is all about [Devices](./Device.md) and the [Cloud](./Cloud.md) communicating.  These conversations are made up of Messages that share data and initiate actions. They generally consist of three parts:

- [Device ID](./DeviceID.md) - which specific [Device](./Device.md) sent the message
- [Message ID](./MessageID.md) - what type of message is being sent
- [Payload](./Payload.md) - the data or value being sent

Message formats are defined in the [Studio](./Studio.md) as reusable objects.  This means that a single Message format may be used in a variety of [Solutions](./Solution.md).

## Example
The bearings' in the *Plymouth Iot Conveyor Belt* began to overheat so it sent a message to the [Cloud](./Cloud.md).  The Message contained the [Device ID](./DeviceID.md) (PICBelt0012), the [Message ID](./MessageID.md) (overheat), and a [Payload](./Payload.md) (435Â°).
