## Example
The employees at *Plymouth Manufacturing* cheered when *NuvIoT* published the Deployment Instance for their factory floor full of *Plymouth IoT Conveyor Belts* and security systems.  Now the belts were connected by the Internet of Things which will monitor their bearing' temperatures and address overheating problems.
