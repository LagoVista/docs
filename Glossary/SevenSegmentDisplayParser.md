# Seven Segment Display Parser
## Definition
NuvIoT contains a powerful feature that allows data to be captured from analog devices.  A camera is used to take a picture of a [Seven Segment Display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-segment_display) and convert that picture into the numeric representation of the data.

## Example
*Plymouth Manufacturing* has a legacy conveyor belt that can only display the speed of the belt on a Seven Segment Display.  The engineer positioned a camera to capture the belt speed and NuvIoT converted the display to a usable number.
