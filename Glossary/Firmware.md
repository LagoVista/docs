# Firmware 
## Definition
Firmware is a type of software located on the [Control Board](./ControlBoard.md) of a [Device](./Device.md) that provides low-level control of a [Device's](./Device.md) functions.  Firmware is a computer program that was created to identify and process [Messages](./Message.md), control and monitor [Devices](./Device.md) activity and provide connectivity to the [Deployment Instance](./DeploymentInstance.md).

## Example
The Firmware on the *Plymouth IoT Conveyor Belts* is programmed to receive the bearings' temperature and build a [Messages](./Message.md) containing that data.  The Firmware then sends the [Message](./Message.md) to the [Deployment Instance](./DeploymentInstance.md).
