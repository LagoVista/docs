# Machine Learning
## Definition
Machine Learning allows *NuvIoT* to analyse data coming from a [Device](./Device.md) in order to identify patterns.  After patterns are established, anomalies can be detected and corrected.

## Example
After collecting vibration data from a *Plymouth Iot Conveyor Belt*, data scientists produced a Machine Learning model.  The model used uploaded vibration data from a running belt to look for anomalies.  After using this model for only two weeks, they were able to detect an abnormal vibration from one of their primary belts and fix it by simply changing the lubricant.  This Machine Learning model eliminated down time and a loss in productivity.
