# Error Code
## Definition
Common failures that occur on a [Device](./Device.md) may be assigned an Error Code on a [Device Configuration](./DeviceConfiguration.md) which can help diagnose and fix problems. Error codes may be generated by 

- the [Device](./Device.md) after receiving a specific [Message](./Message.md)
- a [Watch Dog](./WatchDog.md) that does not receive a [Message](./Message.md) in a predefined period of time
- or if [Business Logic](./BusinessLogic.md) determines there is an error and returns False

An Error Code may be used to perform necessary steps to address the problem.  This may include sending a [Notification](./Notification.md) to a [Distribution List](./DistributionList.md).

Optionally, NuvIoT has a very basic [Field Service](./FieldServiceLite.md) implementation called [Field Service Lite](./FieldServiceLite.md).  Error Codes may generate [Service Tickets](./ServiceTicket.md) which are then managed by the [Field Service](./FieldServiceLite.md) module.

## Example
The *Plymouth IoT Conveyor Belt* sent a [Message](./Message.md) to the [Deployment Instance](./DeploymentInstance.md) with a bearing temperature of 425Â°.  [Business Logic](./BusinessLogic.md) determined this was out of range and generated an Error Code which sent a [Notification](./Notification.md) to the company owner. It also sent a [Message](./Message.md) back to the [Device](./Device.md) to stop the conveyor belt before any damage took place.  No further [Messages](./Message.md) were received by the [Message Watch Dog](./WatchDog.md) which once again generated an Error Code and sent a [Notification](./Notification) to the owner.
