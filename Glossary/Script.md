# Script
## Definition
Scripts are a list of commands written into a [Workflow](./Workflow.md) in a language called JavaScript.  They are used to respond to defined events and provide more advanced functionality.

## Example
When the *Plymouth IoT Conveyor Belt* sent a [Message](./Message.md) that a bearing reached a temperature of 425Â°, Script within the [Workflow](./Workflow.md) compared that value to the predefined threshold for the bearing overheating.  It determined that the bearing was overheating and a [Message](./Device/Message.md) should be sent to stop the belt before damage was done.
