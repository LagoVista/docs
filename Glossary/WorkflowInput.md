# Input
## Definition
When a [Message](./Message.md) is received from a [Device](./Device.md), the [Input Translator](./InputTranslator) is responsible for extracting data from the [Payload](./Payload.md) and making it available within the [Workflow](./Workflow.md).  The data that is produced from the [Input Translator](./InputTranslator) is considered the Workflow Input.

<br>

## Example
The *Plymouth IoT Conveyor Belt* sent a [Message](./Message.md) to its [Deployment Instance](./DeploymentInstance.md) with a [Payload](./Payload) of 425Â°.  This was extracted as an integer and used as Workflow Input into the `temperature` [Workflow](./Workflow.md).
