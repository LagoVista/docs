# Field Service Lite
## Definition
NuvIoT provides a program called *Field Service Lite*.  It offers basic implementation for core features of a typical Field Service Application and was designed to be integrated with a preexisting Application. 

When a [Device](./Device.md) generates an [Error Code](./ErrorCode.md), *Field Service Lite* creates a [Service Ticket](./ServiceTicket.md) providing information about the error.  The [Service Ticket](./ServiceTicket) is then sent to an individual's  [Service Board](./ServiceBoard.md) to be processed.

<br>

## Example
The bearing on a *Plymouth IoT Conveyor Belt* reached a temperature of 425Â°, creating an `overheat` [Error Code](./ErrorCode.md).  This generated a [Service Ticket](./ServiceTicket.md) in *Field Service Lite* and posted the ticket on the floor manager's [Service Board](./ServiceBoard.md).
