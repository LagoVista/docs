# Device Model

## Definition - Make this a drop down 
The Device Model is a piece of hardware that contains a unique set of sensors, actuators, and control boards whose data is processed in a specific manner. A Device Model may contain a number of different [Devices](./Devices.md) that all function in fundamentally the same manner. 

**Example 1**

When *Plymouth Manufacturing* purchased their conveyor belt, they had a choice between two Device Models.  The Standard Device Model had an AC motor driven belt that monitored the bearings' temperature through an IoT platform.  The Elite Device Model had a DC motor driven belt, was made of stronger materials, and monitored both the bearings' temperatures and weight load through an IoT platform.  Both of these Device Models used the same [Device Configuration](./DeviceConfiguration.md).

**Example 2**

Device Models may also be thought of in terms of car models.  Each model of car is different in the way it is constructed.  Some are larger, some have leather seats, some are equipped with GPS and WiFi.  No matter how they are built, they perform in basically the same manner to get you from point A to point B.
